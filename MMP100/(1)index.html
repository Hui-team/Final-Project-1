         <h1> Why is it Important to Improve Water Pollution</h1>
         <h2> 1. What is Water Pollution?</h2>
            
            <p1>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or 
            microorganisms—contaminate a stream,river, lake, ocean, aquifer, 
            or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it 
            toxic to humans or the environment.</p1>
        
         <h3> 2. What Are the Causes of Water Pollution? </h3>
       
            <p2>Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal 
            solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other 
            liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant 
            blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. 
            Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily 
            dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.</p2>
        
        <h4> 3. What Can You Do to Prevent Water Pollution?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>With your actions
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can.</li>
              <li>Properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and non-biodegradable items to keep them from ending up down the drain.</li>
              <li>Maintain your car so it doesn’t leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant.</li>
              <li>If you have a yard, consider landscaping that reduces runoff and avoid applying pesticides and herbicides.</li>
            
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>With your voice
            <ul>
                <li>One of the most effective ways to stand up for our waters is to speak out in support of the Clean Water Rule, which clarifies the Clean Water Act’s scope and protects the drinking water of one in three Americans.</li>
                <li>Tell the federal government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and your local elected officials that you support the Clean Water Rule. Also, learn how you and those around you can get involved in the policymaking process. Our public waterways serve every American. We should all have a say in how they’re protected.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
